Enclosed is the source for a simple command-line messaging service application.

In this application, it is possible to register users and then send messages between users. Currently, the 4 operations that can be performed are:

1.	Add a new user
2.	Send a user a message
3.	Receive all messages for a user
4.	Quit

There is a requirement to extend the message service so that it supports a touch screen device, but first, the legacy code must be cleaned-up and modernized.

Your task is to refactor this code. You are not required to extend the functionality or prepare for future extension other than considering Touch Screen support. Here is a list of the things that we are looking for in the refactored code:

•	Does this code obey the SOLID principles?<br>
•	Has a consistent style been used?<br>
•	Can the code be easily extended to allow for a touch screen device to use the messaging system? (Note: we're not looking for a touch screen implementation or a complicated Console IO system just a very basic use of OOP to separate IO from the main functionality that is somewhat extensible)<br>
•	Is the code clean and easy to understand? E.g. Do the class, method & variable names make sense, do they accurately describe what they're being used for, do they read well?<br>
•	Has appropriate use been made of Modern C++?<br>
•	Has appropriate use been made of const?<br>
•	Have the best data structures been used for the task at hand?<br>
•	Is the code testable? (Note: that we do not require tests to be written for this exercise)<br>

You may either completely re-write the system from scratch, or make appropriate changes to the existing code. You may add new files or delete files if you wish. 

We recommend spending 2 hours on the test but 4 is fine and probablly all that's needed.
